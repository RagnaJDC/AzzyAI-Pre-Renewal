⦁	Added UseSkillOnFollow to M_Config.lua and H_Config.lua 1 = use skill when Hom/Merc following player, 0 = disable
    UseSkillOnFollow allows the Homunculus or Mercenary to use attack skills when in Follow stance and chasing a moving owner player.
    The AI will now use skills when running past enemies, this is usefull for mobs you can 1 hit for farming, allowings you to keep running and gunning.
⦁	Changed Bow/Archer Mercenaries which have Double Strafe to use Double Strafe range as their normal attack range (9 cells for DS compared to 11 cells normal attack)
    As normal attacks would happen before DS range was met, meaning DS could not be used as often as expected.
⦁	Bow/Archer Mercenary skill use optimisation, if double strafe available it now skips skill selection/cycling
    in favour of double strafe skill use only, for improved skill spam.
⦁	Update to AzzyAiConfigPreRe.exe - Added UseSkillOnfollow to auto skill options, removed unused debuff and react options for S Homunculus. Fixed drop down menu sizing so you can actually read the options.
⦁	PVP Tactics overhaul! You can now add Homunculus and Mercenary tactics under PVP tactics PER class/job ID'S
    This means you can now add specific tactics in PVP/WOE/BG per class/job type so the Homun/Merc will react how you want to specific classes.
    You can do this from the AzzyAiConfigPreRe.exe under PVP tactics and Mercenary PVP tactics. All classes are already added with a default tactic, adjust as you need.
    PVP Tactics work with friend list and Ally list for specifics additional tactics with friends and Allys.

Backported fixes and corrections ensuring private server pre-renewal compatibility from https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AzzyAI master source code version 1.56.
Version 1.56 is not compatible with private servers on pre-renewal in Dr Azzys current AzzyAI release due to kRO homunculus AI coding changes so fixes were cherry-picked.
uaRO AzzyAI runs on source code version 1.541 with these version 1.56 fixes ported down.
⦁	Fix issue with pauses bugging up predictive move.
⦁	Corrected issue that could cause rescuer to get distracted .
⦁	Corrected issue where state of skill use count could be lost.
⦁	Corrected issue with Tanking tactic.
⦁	Correct issue with standpoint selection while attacking on low aspd homuns.
⦁	Extend AAI_Closest logging to cover the closely related AdjustStandPoint() function.
⦁	Correct boneheaded mistake in AdjustStandPoint() which resulted in pathing hangs.
⦁	Improve the wrapper for move to hopefully improve chase performance for things far away.
⦁	When all targets are unreachable, return to owner in the hopes that they'll be reachable from there.
⦁	Corrected issue with obstacle handling when chasing monsters near edges of screen.
