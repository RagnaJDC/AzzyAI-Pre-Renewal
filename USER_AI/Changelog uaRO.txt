⦁	Fixed idle walk system AggroHP dependency issue in PvP mode
    Resolved issue where idle walk would be disabled when HP dropped below AggroHP threshold, even in PvP mode where continuous movement is crucial.
    Added GetEffectiveAggroHP() helper function that overrides AggroHP to 0 for idle walk checks when PVPmode=1 is enabled.
    This ensures homunculus maintains defensive movement patterns regardless of HP level in PvP scenarios, while preserving normal AggroHP behavior for enemy targeting.

⦁	Improved PvP mode auto-configuration reliability
    Fixed PvP mode default settings override to always apply optimal configurations regardless of user settings.
    Removed redundant UseIdleWalk != 2 condition that could prevent proper PvP optimization when user had manually set UseIdleWalk=2 but other settings were incorrect.
    PvP mode now guarantees consistent application of UseIdleWalk=2, FollowStayBack=0, and IdleWalkSP=0 whenever PVPmode=1 is enabled.

⦁ Updated H_PVP_Tact.lua & M_PVP_Tact.lua to accept all 13 tactics per entry, with defaults now set for all classes.
⦁ Updated AzzyAiConfigPreRe.exe to support the new PvP tactics files with 13 tactics, including correct save/load functionality and GUI improvements to allow editing all tactic settings.

⦁	Fixed rescue detection failure in GetEnemyList function for retainer cooperation
    Resolved issue where rescue system (aggro=-2) failed to detect valid targets due to perspective-dependent v[2] classification between homunculus and mercenary.
    Added rescue target detection bypass that maintains all existing rescue tactic validation via IsRescueTarget().
    Enables proper homunculus/mercenary rescue cooperation when one retainer is attacked by monsters.

⦁	Enhanced PvP Mode with Automatic Player Protection and Mobile Turret System
    PVPmode=1 now automatically enables player protection idle walk (UseIdleWalk=2) where homunculus moves in diamond pattern 
    around owner position to provide defensive coverage and enhanced battlefield positioning. No manual idle walk configuration required.
    
    Combined with DoNotChase=1, creates advanced mobile turret system for superior PvP positioning:
    - Automatically enables diamond movement pattern (imported from AIthort) for optimal protection coverage
    - Continuously moves around owner while maintaining attack capability on enemies within skill range
    - Ignores out-of-range enemies to prevent movement interruption and maintain positioning
    - Provides mobile turret behavior ideal for PvP scenarios with constant movement and opportunistic attacks
    - Works consistently in both high SP (IDLEWALK_ST) and low SP (IDLE_ST) states
    
    Replaces static crosswalk pattern with dynamic diamond movement for improved battlefield mobility and simplified PvP setup.
    Simply set PVPmode=1 for automatic player protection, or PVPmode=1 + DoNotChase=1 for full mobile turret functionality.

⦁	Added UseSkillOnFollow to M_Config.lua and H_Config.lua 1 = use skill when Hom/Merc following player, 0 = disable
    UseSkillOnFollow allows the Homunculus or Mercenary to use attack skills when in Follow stance and chasing a moving owner player.
    The AI will now use skills when running past enemies, this is usefull for mobs you can 1 hit for farming, allowings you to keep running and gunning.
⦁	Changed Bow/Archer Mercenaries which have Double Strafe to use Double Strafe range as their normal attack range (9 cells for DS compared to 11 cells normal attack)
    As normal attacks would happen before DS range was met, meaning DS could not be used as often as expected.
⦁	Bow/Archer Mercenary skill use optimisation, if double strafe available it now skips skill selection/cycling
    in favour of double strafe skill use only, for improved skill spam.
⦁	Update to AzzyAiConfigPreRe.exe - Added UseSkillOnfollow to auto skill options, removed unused debuff and react options for S Homunculus. Fixed drop down menu sizing so you can actually read the options.
⦁	PVP Tactics overhaul! You can now add Homunculus and Mercenary tactics under PVP tactics PER class/job ID'S
    This means you can now add specific tactics in PVP/WOE/BG per class/job type so the Homun/Merc will react how you want to specific classes.
    You can do this from the AzzyAiConfigPreRe.exe under PVP tactics and Mercenary PVP tactics. All classes are already added with a default tactic, adjust as you need.
    PVP Tactics work with friend list and Ally list for specifics additional tactics with friends and Allys.

Backported fixes and corrections ensuring private server pre-renewal compatibility from https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AzzyAI master source code version 1.56.
Version 1.56 is not compatible with private servers on pre-renewal in Dr Azzys current AzzyAI release due to kRO homunculus AI coding changes so fixes were cherry-picked.
uaRO AzzyAI runs on source code version 1.541 with these version 1.56 fixes ported down.
⦁	Fix issue with pauses bugging up predictive move.
⦁	Corrected issue that could cause rescuer to get distracted .
⦁	Corrected issue where state of skill use count could be lost.
⦁	Corrected issue with Tanking tactic.
⦁	Correct issue with standpoint selection while attacking on low aspd homuns.
⦁	Extend AAI_Closest logging to cover the closely related AdjustStandPoint() function.
⦁	Correct boneheaded mistake in AdjustStandPoint() which resulted in pathing hangs.
⦁	Improve the wrapper for move to hopefully improve chase performance for things far away.
⦁	When all targets are unreachable, return to owner in the hopes that they'll be reachable from there.
⦁	Corrected issue with obstacle handling when chasing monsters near edges of screen.
