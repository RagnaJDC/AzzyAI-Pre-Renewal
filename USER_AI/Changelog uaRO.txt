Backported fixes and corrections ensuring private server pre-renewal compatibility from https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AzzyAI master source code version 1.56.
Version 1.56 is not compatible with private servers on pre-renewal in Dr Azzys current AzzyAI release due to kRO homunculus AI coding changes so fixes were cherry-picked.
uaRO AzzyAI runs on source code version 1.541 with these version 1.56 fixes ported down.
⦁	Fix issue with pauses bugging up predictive move.
⦁	Corrected issue that could cause rescuer to get distracted .
⦁	Corrected issue where state of skill use count could be lost.
⦁	Corrected issue with Tanking tactic.
⦁	Correct issue with standpoint selection while attacking on low aspd homuns.
⦁	Extend AAI_Closest logging to cover the closely related AdjustStandPoint() function.
⦁	Correct boneheaded mistake in AdjustStandPoint() which resulted in pathing hangs.
⦁	Improve the wrapper for move to hopefully improve chase performance for things far away.
⦁	When all targets are unreachable, return to owner in the hopes that they'll be reachable from there.
⦁	Corrected issue with obstacle handling when chasing monsters near edges of screen.
