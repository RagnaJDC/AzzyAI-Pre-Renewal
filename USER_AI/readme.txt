FRIEND MANAGEMENT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
🟢 ADD ALL PLAYERS: Stand up → Alt+Right-click yourself
🔴 CLEAR ALL FRIENDS AND ALLIES: Sit down → Alt+Right-click yourself  
🟡 ADD PVP ALLIES: Stand up → Alt+Right-click your homunculus
🔵 INDIVIDUAL: Stand up → Alt+Right-click 1 cell below or above player

Visual confirmations: Homunculus runs in a Circle (added friends), Homunculus runs in a Cross (removed friends)
Enable: Set MirAIFriending = 1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTO BUFF COLLECTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
🥇 BARDS FIRST: Seeks Bragi and bard songs (priority)
🥈 DANCERS SECOND: Seeks Service for You and dancer songs after a bard or if no bard is available

Setup:
• PickUpBraggi = 1 (bard buffs, set to 0 to disable)
• PickUpDancer = 1 (dancer buffs, set to 0 to disable)

Extended 18-cell range matches uaRO zoom for buff searching. (This works by detecting a song or dance when played. 
It then stores the information of that bard/dancer to use later, it CAN NOT see a currently active song and must see a song be originally played)

CONFIG GUI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Run AzzyAiConfigPreRe.exe in USER_AI folder
• Removal of Renewal features
• Clean interface
